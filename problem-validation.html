                <p style="text-align:center">Farming the cosmos: NASA-funded study investigates effects of space radiation on plants during interplanetary travel. Research@Texas A&M. (2023, February 14). https://research.tamu.edu/2023/02/14/farming-the-cosmos-nasa-funded-study-investigates-effects-of-space-radiation-on-plants-during-interplanetary-travel/ </p>
                <p style="text-align:center">The NASA-funded study led by Texas A&M researchers—Titled “Farming the Cosmos”—investigates how space radiation impacts plants during interplanetary travel. It’s mainly circled around plant telomeres, which protect chromosomes, and their stability under extreme space conditions. Their initial findings suggest that radiation increases telomerase activity, potentially offering more protection. These finding would be crucial to our research, since it would assure us that the plants themself would remain safe and provides insight on genomic stability in harsh environments.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">In NASA’s Glenn Research Center, A.P.EX.—“Advanced Plant Experiment”—performed a series of tests on the ISS to investigate how microgravity affects plants at molecular and genetic levels. A.P.EX.-07 and A.P.EX.-08 both focused on RNA regulation and gene expression—specifically Arabidopsis Thaliana—in space. It validates further research in adapting plants to extraterrestrial environments, adding depth to our project on space simulation on plants for farming.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">Also a NASA-funded study led by Texas A&M’s Dr. Nithya Rajan—Titled “Understanding how Plants can Survive in Space”—explored how plants survive in space by monitoring them with unique wireless leaf sensors. They track plant stress via hormones, seeing their response towards space-like light and temperature. This is important to us because it introduces monitoring a plants behavior in absurd environments, and adds a technical advantage to us besides just the clinostat.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">The patent US7456019B2—"Three-dimensional cell to Tissue Development Process"—describes a clinostat, a
                    device designed to simulate microgravity by rotating biological specimens such as plants, thereby cancelling out
                    the effects of gravity on growth and development. This technology is important for studying how organisms
                    behave in space-like conditions, especially for plant research relevant to space agriculture. The clinostat's ability
                    to mimic space conditions on Earth provides a critical complement to actual space missions, though its results
                    may differ from those conducted in true microgravity environments, necessitating further comparative studies.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">The patent CA2836198A1—"Modified Plant Cell"— also describes a clinostat system, which allows researchers
                    to study the effects of microgravity on plant growth and cellular behavior without needing access to space. This
                    tool helps validate space farming studies by simulating microgravity on Earth, but the accuracy compared to real
                    space conditions remains a concern, prompting the need for further experimentation in actual space
                    environments.</p>

                    results may not fully replicate real microgravity.</p>
