                <p style="text-align:center">Out of the destruction colonialism caused emerged hybrid musical forms rooted in African rhythm, shaped by European melody, and informed by surviving Indigenous elements. Music became more than entertainment... it functioned as a tool of resistance, memory, and survival, allowing Afro-descended communities to preserve identity in societies structured to erase it.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">_________________________________________</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">These blended traditions solidified into genres such as samba in Brazil, son and rumba in Cuba, bomba and plena in Puerto Rico, cumbia in Colombia, and merengue in the Dominican Republic. Though these styles were born under colonial conditions, they carried forward African polyrhythms, call-and-response structures, communal performance, and dance-centered expression. While much Indigenous ceremonial music was lost, its influence remained embedded in rhythmic patterns, instruments, and collective movement.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">_________________________________________</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">In the modern era, artists continue to draw from these historically constructed sounds, transforming them into global musical movements. Musicians such as Celía Cruz, Tito Puente, and Rubén Blades built upon Afro-Cuban traditions, while Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso reimagined Afro-Brazilian rhythms for contemporary audiences. In the Caribbean, artists like Ismael Rivera, Juan Luis Guerra, and Bad Bunny incorporate bomba, plena, merengue, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms into modern popular music. These artists demonstrate how the musical foundations forged under colonialism continue to evolve, serving as powerful expressions of Afro-Latin identity, history, and creative endurance.</p>
