                    <p style="text-align:center">Welcome to my website/final! This website explores the deep and complicated impact colonialism had on Afro-Latin music. From the forced movement of millions of Africans into the Americas to the cultural mixing that unfolded across the Caribbean and Latin America, you’ll discover how rhythms, instruments, and traditions were restricted under colonial rule, but later adapted into entirely new musical styles. When you move through the site, you'll find infromation regarding important figures, context, and a concise timeline that reveal both the harm colonialism caused and the creativity that endured following it. Together, these sections show how colonialism attempted to erase Afro-Latin music but also how Afro-descended communities transformed that destruction into redefining/finding identity, and built the foundations of the Afro-Latin music we know today.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center">See below the link that will take you to the sources I used and the websites I traveled to in order to find the information regarding past native inhabitants and timeline construction.</p>
