                <p style="text-align:center">Day 1: This was the day where we were gathering ideas as to what to create and the direction of where we wanted to go. On my end, it was updating the website to show the problem statements and organize our ideas to be able to track it. </p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 2: We’re beginning the Initial Design Concept document page, so I’m working with my teammate, Jack Sosa, to create and refine the problem statement and start tracking the costs of the products we need for the prototype and test the lighting system. </p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 3: I continued to tinker with document, but the main focus of today was to begin to craft a physical design—not prototype—of the clinostat. I wanted a physical “stepping-off-point” to see the theoretical size of our final clinostat.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 4: This was one of our first meetings with Mr. Mario Cruz, and we were able to present to him a rudimentary prototype of our clinostat! With this prototype, we can now accurately apply what failed and what succeeded to successfully incorporate it into the final design. </p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 5: Today was a housekeeping day, it was transferring the timelines, images, and all the writing into either the document or each of our respective final project website pages.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 6: Today was also a housekeeping day! We're continuting the actual final project design and assemby after the Thanksgiving break.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 7: I was working this day with my teammate Jack to work on the Preliminary Design Review.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">Day 8: We were still working on the Preliminary Design Review, and we've made some good progress but we are planning to finish it today.</p>
