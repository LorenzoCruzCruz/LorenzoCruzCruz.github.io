            <h2 style="text-align:center">Broad Overview of Pre-Colonial Music and Culture</h2>

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Before Europeans arrived in the Americas, Indigenous societies throughout what is now Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic had rich musical traditions that were central to religious life, political identity, and community cohesion. While many pre-colonial musical practices are poorly documented due to the lack of written Indigenous records, historians and ethnomusicologists cite surviving instruments, early colonial chronicles, and later anthropological research to reconstruct aspects of Indigenous soundscapes. For example, Spanish observers described Caribbean ceremonial dances with call-and-response songs accompanied by rattles, slit drums, and flutes—evidence of structured rhythm and communal performance that pre-dates colonial disruption.</p>

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Indigenous peoples in pre-colonial Brazil—including the Tupi, Guaraní, and other groups—used music extensively in ritual and social life. Ethnomusicological research shows Indigenous music in South America relied on drums, flutes, and idiophones tied to ceremonial rhythms, seasonal rites, and shamanic practices, though precise melodic and scale systems remain speculative because of limited historical documentation.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Cuba 🇨🇺</h2>
            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">The Taíno people developed formal musical traditions centered on ceremonial performance. Spanish chroniclers observed areítos, communal song-dance rituals that combined lyrics, choreography, and percussion and were used to narrate history and honor ancestors. These were performed in village plazas with instruments such as maracas and slit drums, showing structured rhythmic and cultural practice.</p>

        <section class="market-research">
            <h2 style="text-align:center">Puerto Rico 🇵🇷</h2>
            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Puerto Rico’s Indigenous population similarly practiced music within the areíto tradition, where rhythmic chants accompanied communal dancing and storytelling. According to Latin American Music scholarship, early Spanish accounts describe these performances as involving call-and-response singing and percussion instruments like the maraca, güiro, and hollowed log drums known as mayohuacán, indicating organized rhythmic structures prior to colonial influence.</p>

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Before European contact, Colombia was home to a variety of Indigenous groups, including the Muisca in the Andes, the Tairona along the northern coast, and the Guahibo in the eastern plains. These communities developed diverse musical traditions that used flutes, panpipes, ocarinas, drums, and rattles. Andean rhythms tended to be steady and ceremonial, supporting agriculture, spiritual rituals, and political gatherings, while coastal and lowland rhythms were often more dance-focused and percussive, incorporating layered patterns for festivals and communal events. Call-and-response singing, repetitive drum pulses, and coordinated ensemble playing were common, demonstrating how music connected social, spiritual, and cultural life.</p>

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Taíno societies used music in ceremonial contexts much like their Cuban and Puerto Rican counterparts. Spanish accounts describe areítos involving community performance with percussion and chants, indicating rhythmic structuring and musical storytelling prior to European disruption. Child and adult participants used instruments such as rattles and drums, reflecting integrated musical life.</p>
