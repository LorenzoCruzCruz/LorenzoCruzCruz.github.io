        <h1>African American and Africana Studies: The Impact of Colonialism on Afro-Latin Music</h1>
        <p>Lorenzo Cruz-Cruz</p>
        <p>Welcome to my website/final! This website explores the deep and complicated impact colonialism had on Afro-Latin music. From the forced movement of millions of Africans into the Americas to the cultural mixing that unfolded across the Caribbean and Latin America, you’ll discover how rhythms, instruments, and traditions were restricted under colonial rule, but later transformed and developed into entirely new musical styles. As you move through the site, you’ll find key historical figures, major events, and essential cultural context that reveal both the harm colonialism caused and the creativity that endured following it. Together, these sections show how colonialism attempted to erase Afro-Latin music but also how Afro-descended communities transformed that destruction into new genres, reclaimed identity, and built the foundations of the Afro-Latin music we know today.</p>
