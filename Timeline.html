            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">Colonialism in the Americas began at the end of the fifteenth century with European arrival in the Caribbean, including Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Cuba, and parts of South America. As Spanish and Portuguese control expanded, Indigenous musical traditions were severely disrupted. Taíno ceremonial practices such as areítos, communal dances, and drum-based rituals declined as Indigenous populations were devastated by disease, forced labor, and violence. European colonizers imposed new cultural systems, introducing Christian chants, European harmonic ideas, and stringed instruments like the early Spanish guitar. At the same time, the forced arrival of enslaved Africans to Hispaniola, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Colombia introduced complex polyrhythms, percussion-centered ensembles, call-and-response singing, and work songs that became essential tools for cultural survival under colonial rule.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">1600s: Musical Blending and Cultural Survival</h2>
            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">During the seventeenth century, African, Indigenous, and European musical traditions increasingly blended across the Caribbean and Latin America, including the Dominican Republic. African rhythmic structures became central to musical expression, while Indigenous percussion and ceremonial movement survived in altered forms. European influence shaped melody and song structure, but rhythm increasingly defined Afro-Latin music. In Brazil, African and Indigenous percussion merged into early forms of lundu and maracatu. In Cuba, African drumming traditions contributed to the development of rumba and son. In Puerto Rico, African rhythms combined with Taíno percussion and Spanish forms, laying the groundwork for bomba and plena. On Hispaniola, African rhythms blended with residual Taíno influences and European elements, shaping early Dominican musical practices that emphasized dance, percussion, and communal performance.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">1700s to 1800s: Hybridization</h2>
            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Afro-Latin music had become fully hybridized, particularly in urban centers such as Havana, Salvador, Cartagena, and Santo Domingo. Music expanded beyond ritual spaces into public celebrations, labor contexts, and social gatherings. African-derived percussion dominated ensembles, European harmonic structures influenced melody, and Indigenous elements persisted through rhythmic patterns, instruments, and collective performance. In the Dominican Republic, these influences contributed to the development of African-derived dance rhythms that would later inform merengue and other national styles. Although many purely Indigenous ceremonial forms had disappeared, their influence remained embedded within Afro-Latin musical practices across the region.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Late 1800s to Early 1900s: Consolidation of Afro-Latin Genres</h2>
            <div class="market">
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p style="text-align:center">In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these blended traditions solidified into recognizable genres that continue to shape Afro-Latin music today. Samba in Brazil retained African rhythmic intensity while incorporating European melodic structures. In Cuba, son and rumba preserved African percussion and call-and-response traditions alongside Spanish guitar and harmonic progressions. Puerto Rican bomba and plena developed as public expressions of Afro-Puerto Rican identity, emphasizing drum dialogue and dance. In Colombia, cumbia spread from coastal communities into national culture, blending African drums, Indigenous flutes, and European influences. In the Dominican Republic, merengue emerged from earlier Afro-Dominican rhythmic traditions, combining African-derived percussion with European instruments, becoming a powerful symbol of national and Afro-descended identity.</p>
